## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
3. Setup Your API Key

This app relies on the public Weather API from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Please set up your API key there.

   1. In the root folder of your project, create a `.env` file.
   2. Inside the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from Weather API:


      ```bash
      API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
      ```

Make sure to keep your API key secure and not expose it in your version control.
